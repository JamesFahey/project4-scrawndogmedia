# About

My ambition is to create a functioning and responsive website for photography and videography business, Scrawndog Media. The website will allow users to book the owners services for a number or events or organise a personal shoot for themselves or family. 

The sites purpose is to enable effective management and handling of bookings and work load for the owners. Allowing the owner to take bookings and manage their diary of upcoming events. Designed to grow with the business itself. Popularity growth will correlate to additional features being made available, with user experience a priority

For my user stories and epics I have taken an Agile approach. 

After creating my user stories, I assigned each a tag with varying levels of importance. These ranged from the most important tag ‘Must have’, ‘Should have’ for the features which should be included and the least important tagged ‘could have’. I attached a user story with a fourth tag of ‘Won’t do’ as it will not be implemented during this project however it would be beneficial to add at a later date.

Once all user stories had been finalised, I created Github Project in a Kanban format. Using these project boards allowed for greater ease in organising and prioritising my work. My project board was comprised of columns labelled; To do, In progress, Done and Future content. All user stories, known as issues in the project, began in the ‘To do’ column and progressed them throughout the project.
